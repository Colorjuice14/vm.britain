    mon.20.d:0 "Mongolian history in the centuries past has not been kind to extravagant and mighty history of the Nation of Conquerors.\n\nSince the collapse of the Mongol empire and its successive rump states, the reputation of the Mongol nation had been in decline. Ultimately, with the collapse of the remnants of the Yuan dynasty in the insignificant wastes of Siberia, Mongolia drifted from the worlds stage. Even with its extravagant record of successful revolutions under the Chinese dynasties that would come after it, and the impact Mongol culture and society had in China, especially in the late Qing dynasty, Mongolia failed to recapture its glory. Even the recently fallen Bogd Khanate and the antics of Baron Ungern Von Sternberg were not mighty enough.\n\nNow,thanks to the events of recent history Mongolia has the opportunity to retake a position on the worlds stage.\n\nAfter the tumultuous history of the past three decades a clear leadership from the 1921 revolution has ascended triumphant with the ability to lay a grand new pathway forward. However, even in the newly established communist party, not all is well. A far left and moderate wing of the party, vie for power over the disparate peoples of the nation. The former seeks to establish absolute and dominant control under a new workers revolution in the country, with the guidance from the Soviet Union, in which all dissidents are crushed. Whereas the latter seeks to form a peaceful place in the world for the Mongol peoples, free from the tyranny of the larger threats around it.\n\nHowever, not all of Mongolia’s threats come from the outside, whilst the 1921 revolution has installed a pro-soviet regime, its ascertainment of power has not been as total as was in the Soviet Union. A Botched attempted purging of the Buddhist Lama’s has left a gross scar on the face of all factions of the communist party, and many of their higher ranking religious and nationalist opponents still remain within the nation, in hiding, and among loyalist factions. Waiting for the right time to strike and return Mongolia to its noble position in the world. But first and foremost, the Japanese Military poses an immediate threat."
