Drawing upon historical ties and strategic vision, the UK reaffirms its role as a dominant force in shaping the continent's destiny.\n\nWhile some may view our actions with skepticism, we stand unwavering in our commitment to reclaiming our rightful place in history. The recreation of the Angevin Empire heralds a new chapter of strength and leadership for the United Kingdom, ensuring our enduring presence in the annals of time."

 britain.30.desc:0 "Edward VIII of House Windsor, inexperienced upon taking the throne, has now surpassed expectations.

De Gaulle is trying to convince Churchill that some dramatic move is essential to give Reynaud the support which he needs to keep his Government in the war. De Gaulle called Reynaud and told him that the British prime minister proposed a union between their countries, an idea which Reynaud immediately supported.\n\nDe Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to the document proclaiming a joint citizenship, foreign trade, currency, war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet is meeting again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognize the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet.\n\nOther French leaders are less enthusiastic."
