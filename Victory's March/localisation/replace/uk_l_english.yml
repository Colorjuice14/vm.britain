 britain.28.t:0 "Reorganization of Africa"
 britain.28.desc:0 "Africa has been under our dominion for many years. It is time we allow them to self-rule, however we are confronted with the question of how they will be organized. We have two options, allow the nations be formed on ethnicity or confederate the colonies together based on geographical significance."
 britain.28.a:0 "Release Nations based on Ethnicity"
 britain.28.b:0 "Confederate the Colonies"
 
 britain.29.t:0 "Ressurgence of the Angevin Empire"
 britain.29.desc:0 "Asserting rightful claims to territories once under Angevin rule, particularly in France, British forces launch a decisive offensive, swiftly securing key regions. This bold endeavor symbolizes a triumphant resurgence of British power and influence on the European stage. Drawing upon historical ties and strategic vision, the UK reaffirms its role as a dominant force in shaping the continent's destiny.\n\nWhile some may view our actions with skepticism, we stand unwavering in our commitment to reclaiming our rightful place in history. The recreation of the Angevin Empire heralds a new chapter of strength and leadership for the United Kingdom, ensuring our enduring presence in the annals of time."
 britain.29.a:0 "Dieu et mon droit."

 britain.30.t:0 "Edward VIII, King of England and France"
 britain.30.desc:0 "Edward VIII of House Windsor, inexperienced upon taking the throne, has now surpassed expectations. He has proclaimed himself a new title; King of France with his other titles, King of the United Kingdom and Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India. The French have not been under English control since the House of Plantagenet during the 12th and 13th century. Where will this newfound confidence in our King lead us now?"
 britain.30.a:0 "Rex Angliae e Gaule Dei Gratia"
 
 britain.31.t:0 "Our Royal Roots"
 britain.31.desc:0 "Our magnanimous monarch can trace his family roots to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha takes its name from its oldest domain, the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and its members later sat on the thrones of Belgium, Bulgaria, Portugal, and our United Kingdom.\n\nWe stand with a duty to restore our fallen royal family's kingdoms. We march on Belgium, Bulgaria, and Portugal, reclaiming our family's former glory. Let us rise, united, for our ancestors and our homeland's honor!"
 britain.31.a:0 "Cowards never won heaven."
 
 britain.32.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 britain.32.desc:0 "Historically, the Plantagenets, founders of the Angevin Empire of old, held court primarily on the continent at Angers in Anjou, and at Chinon in Touraine. We have some in our court which would like to entertain the idea of moving our capital to this location. This would certainly come to have its own host of benefits and detriments. What shall we do?"
 britain.32.a:0 "London is the seat of our Empire."
 britain.32.b:0 "Let us continue to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors."
 
 britain.33.t:0 "Brazil, A New British Colony"

 britain.37.desc:0 "Tsar Ferdinand I belongs to the house 'Battenberg'. This royal house was changed from the original title 'Saxe-Coburg-Gotha' which our own house, 'Windsor' is also derived from.

 britain.38.t:0 "Last Resort:0 Franco-British Union"
 britain.38.desc:0 "Reynaud supporter Charles de Gaulle had arrived in London earlier today and Monnet told him about the proposed Franco-British union. De Gaulle is trying to convince Churchill that some dramatic move is essential to give Reynaud the support which he needs to keep his Government in the war. De Gaulle called Reynaud and told him that the British prime minister proposed a union between their countries, an idea which Reynaud immediately supported.\n\nDe Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to the document proclaiming a joint citizenship, foreign trade, currency, war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet is meeting again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognize the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet.\n\nOther French leaders are less enthusiastic."
