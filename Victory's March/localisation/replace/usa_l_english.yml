Morgan banking conglomerate, and Grayson Murphy, a respected figure in the boards of Goodyear Tire, Anaconda Copper, and Bethlehem Steel. It was reported that arms and munitions would be supplied by the Remington Arms company of Bridgeport, now under DuPont.\n\nDespite the gravity of the revelations, legal repercussions were withheld due to fear of panic amongst the citizens of the United States. Nevertheless, the conclusive report of the congressional committee affirmed, 'there is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.'"

With fervent support from disaffected Southerners and sympathizers of the fascist cause, the Silver Legion swiftly consolidates control over the region, imposing its vision of a racially pure and authoritarian state.\n\nMeanwhile, in the industrial heartlands of the North and Midwest, Browder's Socialist States of America rise to prominence, championing the cause of socialism and proletarian revolution. Embracing a platform of social justice, economic equality, and collective ownership of resources, the Socialist States attract support from workers, intellectuals, and marginalized communities eager to challenge the status quo.\n\nWith no end in sight and the future of America hanging in the balance, the Second American Civil War threatens to reshape the nation's destiny for generations to come."

It was largely designed and passed through Congress in [GetYear] in a bipartisan effort led by the American Legion which wanted to reward practically all wartime veterans.\n\nJohn H. Stelle, a former Democratic Governor of Illinois, served as the Chairman of the Legion's Executive Committee, which drafted and mobilized public opinion to get the G.I. Bill to President [GetLeader]'s desk on [GetDateText]. Stelle was rewarded for his efforts by the Legion which unanimously elected him its National Commander in [GetYear]. He is commonly referred to as the 'Father of the G.I. Bill.'\n\nThe final bill provided immediate financial rewards for practically all World War II veterans, thereby avoiding the highly disputed postponed life insurance policy payout for World War I veterans that had caused political turmoil in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBenefits included low-cost mortgages, low-interest loans to start a business or farm, one year of unemployment compensation, and dedicated payments of tuition and living expenses to attend high school, college, or vocational school. These benefits were available to all veterans who had been on active duty during the war years for at least 90 days and had not been dishonorably discharged."
