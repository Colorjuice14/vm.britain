 # Czech Perspective
 germany.207.t:0 "The Munich Conference Starts"
 germany.207.desc:0 "Germany has started a low-intensity skirmish on the our borders. Poland and Hungary also appear to be grouping its military along the our border. The United Kingdom has informed us they will be holding a meeting, of which we are not invited to despite it being our territory in question, to discuss a cease-fire. We can only hope that our allies will negotiate well on our behalf."

 germany.204.a:0 "Peace in our time!"
 
 germany.205.t:0 "The Runciman Report"
 germany.205.desc:0 "Lord Runciman has been sent on a diplomatic mission to Czechoslovakia. His report is as follows:\n\n'Czech officials and Czech police, speaking little or no German, were appointed in large numbers to purely German districts; Czech agricultural colonists were encouraged to settle on land confiscated under the Land Reform in the middle of German populations; for the children of these Czech invaders Czech schools were built on a large scale; there is a very general belief that Czech firms were favoured as against German firms in the allocation of State contracts and that the State provided work and relief for Czechs more readily than for Germans.\n\nI believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.'"
 germany.205.a:0 "It is hard to deny the legimitacy of these claims now."
