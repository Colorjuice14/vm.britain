 vm.china.1.t: "Crisis in Xi'an: The Fate of the Republic"
 vm.china.1.d: "Shock has gripped the nation. In early December 1936, while Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was visiting the northern city of Xi'an, rebel forces under General Zhang Xueliang and General Yang Hucheng seized him. \n\nTheir ultimatum is as stark as it is divisive: end the bitter civil war with the Communists and redirect all military efforts to resist the Japanese invasion. \n\nAlthough many in our nation—already wearied by years of internal strife—view this as a necessary sacrifice to safeguard China from foreign aggression, others see it as a treasonous act against our national ideals. As the leader of the Republic of China, you must decide how to steer the country through this internal crisis without allowing our enemies to exploit our disunity."

My fellow countrymen, it is our duty to preserve our sovereignty, to foster an inclusive and representative government, and to ensure the welfare of every citizen. Let us cast aside division and discontent. \n\nUnited in our common purpose, we shall forge a future where our great nation rises, unbowed and unyielding, in the face of all adversity.
