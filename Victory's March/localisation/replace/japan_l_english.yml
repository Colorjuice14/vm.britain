 JAP.22.t:0 "Okada Emerges from Hiding"
 JAP.22.desc:0 "Okada was one of the democratic and moderate voices against the increasing strength of the militarists, and was therefore a major target for extremist forces pushing for a more totalitarian Japan. He narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident of 1936, largely because rebel troops killed Colonel Denzō Matsuo, brother-in-law as well as personal secretary of Okada's, by misidentifying him as the prime minister. Okada emerged from hiding on 29 February 1936. With the recent failed coup, Okada has more support for his democratic movement."

JAP.114.desc:0 "Democratic elements in the government have instigated a surprise take-over of the country, after the military threatened to once again curb the people's hard-gained democratic rights. With a surprising alacrity, a significant portion of the military has taken up arms in defense of the people and their rights to liberty.\n\nThis split in the military has allowed for the people's representatives to seize power in the legislative and executive branches.

They have occupied Tokyo city and have secured control of the Imperial Palace, announcing their intent to purge the government of 'corrupt officials' and 'ideological threats', reinstating the Emperor as the sole ruler of the nation.\n\nTheir actions had an unexpectedly large following in the military, where intended counter-operations were forestalled by mass arrests and assassinations of elements loyal to the old government. Faced with the sudden and overwhelming nature of events, as well as rebel control of the palace, the Emperor has made no move to denounce the rebels.\n\nOrganized government resistance seems already to crumble, and the rebels are expected at any time to announce the establishment of total Imperial control to all areas of domestic, foreign, and military policy. Emperor Hirihito has become disillusioned with the leadership of the military and the Prime Ministers and will assume complete control of the government."
