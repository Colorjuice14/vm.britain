As a result, the Egyptian people are less than dissatisfied with his control."

 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Egypt is a constitutional monarchy still under the lingering grip of British influence. Though formally independent since 1922, its sovereignty is curtailed by external controls over strategic assets—the Suez Canal and Sudan remain vital yet contentious points. \n\nCaught between the aspiration for full independence and the pragmatic need for security amid rising threats from Fascist Italy, Egypt’s internal and external policies remain a delicate balancing act in a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape."
