It lasted a long time, but in the end, five thousand people gathered on the street where the speech was held. After the speech, people organized a small rally, although it was not more than nothing. Eventually, battles between citizens with different political views began to take place in the city. They lasted an hour, the police could not do anything, although some of the police joined the rioters. The royal guard eventually arrived in the city, and now she is faced with a choice .Who should be arrested? Supporters of the republic or monarchy?"

 morocco.5.t:0 "Demonstration in front of the government building."
 morocco.5.d:0 "We received reports that a huge crowd of supporters of pan-Arbism and democratic views had gathered in front of the government building. So far, the motives and goals of the gathering are being established, but they are exclusively peaceful, most likely organized to popularize their movement through the news, which will clearly help in the country’s upcoming elections. Now we need to decide what to do with them.\nWe can immediately discard the options of suppressing the demonstration, because the Pan-Arabist movement is quite popular and strong, and we do not need unnecessary unrest. If you prohibit mention of this demonstration, this will clearly worsen the Sultan’s reputation among the residents of the capital, but will clearly prevent the strengthening of the opposition throughout the country.\nThe second option is to try to discredit the demonstrators, and with them the movement, which may, on a subconscious level, lower the people’s trust in them. But there is a possibility of popularizing our direct competitors in this way. The situation is quite complicated..."
 morocco.5.a:0 "Ban news outlets from mentioning the demonstration"
 morocco.5.b:0 "Try to discredit them through news publications"

 morocco.8.t:0 "Capital Question"
 morocco.8.d:0 "After the proclamation of the Federation, the issue of choosing a capital became acute, because it should be both convenient and satisfy the needs of the peoples living in our country. Rabat is the motherland of our Federation, home to our Sultan. Casablanca, although it does not boast a large number of significant events, is a convenient trading port, in which the same can be said about Algeria - also a convenient trading city, but already more susceptible to blockade, like Tunisia in principle. All cities are good options"
 morocco.8.a:0 "How about Algiers?"
 morocco.8.b:0 "Tunisia is a good port."
 morocco.8.c:0 "Rabat is a best option"
