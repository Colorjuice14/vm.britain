 vm.uk.pol.1.t: "Labour Government Elected"
 vm.uk.pol.1.d: "The ousting of the Prime Minister has pushed the King towards dissolving Parliament and calling for a new election to find a popular mandate. Despite the Conservative Party winning the 1935 elections in a landslide, the recent governmental instability has led to massive popular support for the opposition led by Labour under Clement Attlee. The results have put Labour into slim majority in the Commons. Labour has already declared a firm stance against further German aggression and is preparing to advance social reforms, including expanded welfare programs and public health measures, while also promosing not to impose conscription for the near future."
 vm.uk.pol.1.a: "How long will the Labour mandate hold?"
 
 vm.uk.pol.2.t: "Labour Branches out"
 vm.uk.pol.2.d: "On the tails of the surpise success in the recent snap election, [ENG.GetLeader] is seeking to expand the Labour coalition to gain support for more radical policies that the general party is divided on. The Labour Party has extended invitations to the Syndicalist League, Rural Unionists, and other left-leaning groups to join a broad coalition government.  By incorporating a wider array of movements—industrial workers, farmers, and progressive intellectuals—the government aims to shore up domestic support and unify policy on social welfare and defense."

 vm.uk.pol.3.t: "The Popular Front forms"
 vm.uk.pol.3.d: "[ENG.GetLeader]'s efforts to court rural and urban unions have paid off, and Labour has now rebranded itself as the 'Popular Front'. This new formation emphasizes socialist principles, collective ownership, and solidarity with international left movements. The Popular Front pledges expansive welfare reforms, public ownership of key industries, and a steadfast stance against authoritarianism abroad. Motions are being made for another early election which will determine whether [ENG.GetLeader]'s sought after reforms will become a reality."
 vm.uk.pol.3.a: "Can the left keep a winning streak?"
 
 vm.uk.pol.4.t: "Popular Front wins Election"
 vm.uk.pol.4.d: "In an election widely seen as a referendum on [ENG.GetLeader]'s leadership and proposed policies, the Popular Front has managed to sweep the elections in a landslide. Just how far they are willing to go remains to be seen."

 vm.uk.rev.4.d:0 "Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] has introduced sweeping constitutional reforms to establish the [ENG.GetRulingParty] as the sole legal party.  Under the new amendments, all elected officials must be party members, and the office of Prime Minister is held for life or until voluntary resignation—-ending competitive party politics in Britain. Authority has shifted from Parliament to the Prime Minister’s office.

 # Establish President's Council defunct
 vm.uk.rev.9.t:0 "Dutt's Coup!"
 vm.uk.rev.9.d:0 "It seems that Prime Minister Harry Pollitt's position was much less secure than he had thought. A faction supported by Stalinist hardliners has forced Pollitt to resign his from his brief stint in office. He has been replaced as PM by Rajani Palme Dutt, member of the Communist Party's executive committee and former editor of The Daily Worker. Dutt has committed the party to model itself on the administration of Iosef Stalin.

 vm.uk.rev.12.t:0 "Worker Market Liberty"

 vm.uk.rev.17.t:0 "The New Future"
 vm.uk.rev.17.d:0 "Anarcho-syndicalism is proclaimed the guiding ideology of the nation.  Power is to rest with workers’ and peasants’ councils, free from state coercion.  All sectors of the economy will be self-managed, and social services provided by federations of syndicates in a genuinely horizontal political order."
 vm.uk.rev.17.a:0 "Embrace Syndicalist Vision"

 vm.britain.1.d:0 "In the winter of [GetYear], Sir Thomas Inskip, Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, convened a private council at Claridge’s.  Intelligence from across the Channel reported unprecedented rearmament, while alarming reports of mechanized warfare tactics reached Whitehall’s inner circle.\n\nThe Committee on Imperial Defence summoned senior officers of the Army, Navy, and Royal Air Force beneath portraits of Wellington and Nelson.
